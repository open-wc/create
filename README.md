## Scaffold generators

These generators help you kickstart a new app or web component.
They will create a new folder and set up everything you need to get started immediately.

Example usage:

```bash
npm init @open-wc
# Select "Scaffold a new project"
```

### Available scaffold generators:

- `Web Component`<br/>
  This generator scaffolds a starting point for a web component. We recommend using this generator when you want to develop and publish a single web component.
  <br/>

- `Application`<br/>
  This generator scaffolds a new starter application. We recommend using this generator at the start of your web component project.
  <br/>

## Features

The above generators are the perfect playgrounds to prototype.
Add linting, testing, demoing and building whenever the need arises.

Example usage:

```bash
cd existing-web-component
npm init @open-wc
# select "Upgrade an existing project" or add features while scaffolding
```

### Available Upgrade features

- `Linting`<br>
  This generator adds a complete linting setup with ESLint, Prettier, Husky and commitlint.
  <br/>

- `Testing`<br>
  This generator adds a complete testing setup with Web Test Runner.
  <br/>

- `Demoing`<br>
  This generator adds a complete demoing setup with Storybook.
  <br/>

- `Building`<br>
  This generator adds a complete building setup with Rollup.
  <br/>
